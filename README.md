# work-day-scheduler

## Description

The objective of this project was to create a calendar app that can be used for scheduling your work day.

The schedule includes regular working hours (9 AM - 5 PM), with an individual textarea for each hour. After typing in a description of your task or meeting for a specific hour, the save button will save the entry to an array which is saved in local storage. If you refresh the page, it'll populate the textareas using local storage.

The textareas also have different background colors depending on how the current time is compared to each time block. If the time block's hour is in the future it is green, if it is the current hour it is red, if it is in the past it is grey.
